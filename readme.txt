< Description of what my project does - This Assignment A1 is a command prompt shell script that moves the files called: (CatchingAHorse_Data.zip) and (StudioPoseOLAF.obj) from the download folder to the \Builds folder. The script then pauses and asks you to proceed before finding all the Vertices in the file called:(StudioPoseOLAF.obj).

This is a Windows Command Prompt shell that moves files to a given location and finds all the points and vertices of a given file and exports them into two separate files in a directory.>
